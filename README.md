# Cybersecurity (ELC-470)
## Using any language of our choice, we are to build an AES that will encrypt and decrypt a plain text using a secret key. We are then also supposed to implement this in Verilog.

## Python Implementation (Dirk)
[Here is the code for the python implementation](https://github.com/dirky9000/AES-Implementation/blob/main/python_implementation.py)

## C++ Implementation (Alex)
[Here is the code for the c++ implementation](https://github.com/dirky9000/AES-Implementation/blob/main/c%2B%2B_implementation.cpp)
